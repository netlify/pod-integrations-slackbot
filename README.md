# Developer Experience

This is a repo for DX-related things. Right now we use it for a few small utilities.

Most of what this org does happens in [our Notion docs](https://www.notion.so/netlify/About-DX-Netlify-876ff549e02646b7b4d889e025ec7768).

You can also find us [on Slack in #crew-all-dx](https://netlify.slack.com/archives/CCC1HDWQY).

> **NOTE:** a lot of the code in this repo is copy-pasta from https://github.com/learnwithjason/slack-bot, which is released under the ISC license.
